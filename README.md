# Reed-thesis
This repo contains the scripts and R/latex code used to make this Reed College thesis on the microbiome, Crohn's Disease, and random forests. 

The pre-processing pipeline used here is now outdated and should not be used. I rarefied in this analysis because I was trying to reproduce the results of Gevers et al, but for original research I would recommend against it.






















If you'd like to use part of the R code or thesis, please cite:

Thanks!
